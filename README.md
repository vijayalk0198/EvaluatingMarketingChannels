# Evaluating Marketing Channels for FoodFusion Campaigning Data
The FoodFusion Marketing Campaign Data is a simulated dataset created to provide a realistic scenario for analyzing marketing campaigns. It contains information about users who received marketing messages from FoodFusion, a meal kit delivery service, across various channels. This project focuses on evaluating the effectiveness of these marketing channels in driving user subscription and retention. By exploring subscription and retention analysis, segmentation, and other aspects of marketing data science, the goal is to identify the most effective channels for customer acquisition and retention. Ultimately, the project aims to provide data-driven insights to optimize FoodFusion's marketing strategies.
